# Shop

Technology used : 

- HTML/CSS
- Angular JS (Javascript Framework)

**Alcohol Shop**:

Creating a shop to sell products. As an example, my shop is selling alcohol ( not selling to minors). 
Every information is locally saved for persistence.
Infos button allows you to have more informations about the specific product that the user wants to buy.

In your cart you can have access to all of the items created and being able, as in any selling website, to add and remove items or items' quantity from your cart.

In my opinion, the creation of an online shop is a must in Web-development.
